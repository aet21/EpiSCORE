Package: EpiSCORE
Title: Epigenetic cell-type deconvolution with Single-Cell Omic References
Version: 0.9.6
Description: EpiSCORE is an R package aimed at performing cell-type deconvolution of DNA methylation data from solid tissues. With EpiSCORE you can: (i) construct a tissue specific DNA methylation (DNAm) reference matrix (this is done by imputation from a corresponding tissue specific scRNAseq atlas), (ii) estimate fractions for the main cell types in a bulk-tissue sample for which a genome-wide DNAm profile exists. (iii) in conjunction with our EpiDISH package you can then also infer cell-type specific DNAm changes. In this package we also provide the first installment of a DNAm-atlas containing DNAm reference matrices for 13 tissue-types, encompassing 42 cell-types.
