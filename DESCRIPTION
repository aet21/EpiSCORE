Package: EpiSCORE
Title: Epigenetic cell-type deconvolution with Single-Cell Omic References
Version: 0.9.1
Description: EpiSCORE is an R package to construct a tissue specific DNA methylation (DNAm) reference matrix starting out from a corresponding tissue specific scRNAseq atlas. With the DNAm reference matrix one can then estimate fractions for the main cell types present in the reference matrix in a bulk-tissue sample for which a genome-wide DNAm profile exists. In addition, the package allows inference of cell type specific differential DNAm in the context of a general epigenome-wide association study.
